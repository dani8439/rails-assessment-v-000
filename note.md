#Need to add:
  -time slots should probably have a description
  -make sure all params strong[User_time_slots, sessions]
  -set up navigation in layout
  -check only user or admin can edit profile

#Maybe add
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
