#Need to add:
  -add edit user link to user index
  -admin can view each user
  -what should be the home page? Split out from user profile?
  -add note if no new slots available
  -big when submit new time_slot
  -time_slot show add who signed up for admin view
  -time_slot index should have link to view and edit


#Maybe add
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to
  -time slots should probably have a description

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
