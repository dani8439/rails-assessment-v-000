#Need to add:
  -set up navigation in layout
  -add edit user link to user index
  -admin can view each user
  -what should be the home page? Split out from user profile?
  -add note if no new slots available

#Maybe add
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to
  -time slots should probably have a description

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
