#Need to add:
  -validation to prevent a user from signing up for the same time slot more than once
  -validation user.email unique
  -prevent more than cap signing up for a time slot
  -on available time slots page show which ones already sign up for
  -time slots should probably have a description
  -change all available to scope method
  -make sure all params strong
  -make sure not creating junk user_time_slots when not selected
  -add end time
  -maybe add confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
