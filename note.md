#Need to add:
  -validation to prevent a user from signing up for the same time slot more than once
  -prevent more than cap signing up for a time slot
  -on available time slots page show which ones already sign up for
  -time slots should probably have a description
  -change all available to scope method
  -make sure all params strong
  -make sure not creating junk user_time_slots when not selected
  -make duration more clear on form
  -make start_time 12 hr on form
  -nested routes
  -use layout for only some actions in a controller?
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to
  -skip layout for some actions? (getting logout button on sign up page is weird)
  -check what happens when unknown user tries to log in

#Maybe add
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
