#Need to add:
  -add note if no new slots available
  -big when submit new time_slot
  -time_slot show add who signed up for admin view
  -time_slot index should have link to view and edit
  -add message to tine slot page if haven't signed up for any
  -past time slots vs upcoming time slots
  -does my nested resource include a form?
  -field with errors
  -check dryness
  -update seeds
  -what happens if already have an account and try to log in with fb?


#Maybe add
  -log in with google
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to
  -time slots should probably have a description
  -ugh should really be first name and last name

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
  -admin can mark people as attended
  -volunteer reports
