#Need to add:
  -prevent more than cap signing up for a time slot
  -on available time slots page show which ones already sign up for
  -time slots should probably have a description
  -change all available to scope method
  -make sure all params strong[User_time_slots, sessions]
  -set up navigation in layout
  -display time_slots in chronological order
  -don't display past time_slots
  -check only user or admin can edit

#Maybe add
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
